Welcome to Limbo, the hottest new social media platform!

Limbo Jargon
Boers = users
Limbs = user posts

Now that Facebook is on it’s way out for violating privacy concerns, the time is ripe for Limbo to take the throne as the trending social media application.

Limbo is very user friendly and uses a combination of new technologies to provide a seamless and easy user experience

Here’s how it works:

Limbo uses an Auth0 authentication portal to sign in and sign up. Boers may authenticate using simply a username and password or, for a more seamless Web 2.0 experience, by using their existing Google account.

Once Boers are authenticated, they are brought to the global feed page. From this page, Boers can see all of the posts that have been made previously. From this feed page, Boers have the option to post limbs that are viewable to the world. Limbs can contain images such as jpegs or gifs; images may be added by clicking the ‘add image’ button on the bottom of the limb creation dialogue. Boers can also embed YouTube videos in their posts to share with their fellow boers. To embed a YouTube video, simply copy and paste a link into a new limb’s content area, and the limb creation dialogue automagically detects and embeds the video!

Boers can use the nav bar to navigate to their profile. Once on their profile, they can view their own limbs and change their profile photo and cover photo as well as edit their previously posted limbs. In order to edit any information on the profile, a Boer simply needs to click the editing lock at the top right of the page. Once the lock is open, a Boer may change any of the information on the profile page by clicking on the newly enabled editing icons. To disable editing, the lock only needs to be clicked again.

Boers can also use the nav bar to search users by first and last name by using the search box. Once a fellow Boer has been identified, it is possible to navigate to that Boer’s profile by clicking on their name.

Boers can like limbs (except their own) a total of one time. The thermometer icon at the bottom right of the shows the general temperature (number of likes) of each limb. To see an exact count of the number of likes, Boers simply have to hover their mouse over the thermometer icon and a popup shows the number of likes a limb has.

Those are the basics of Limbo. The seamless user experience lends to a gentle learning curve. We look forward to dethroning Facebook and giving the people the experience they deserve.
